Project Title: Joaquin's High School Graduation Dinner 2026
Graduation: Miramonte High School (Orinda, CA)
Brand Identity: Forest Green (#2D5A27) and White. Modern, clean, and celebratory.
Scope: A phased digital experience moving from "Save the Date" to a full RSVP/Menu site for ~15 guests.
Stack: GitHub (hosting/code), Canva (design/visuals), Mobile-first Tailwind CSS.

*important... pages should recognize that the dinner is hosted by Joaquin's Nana Rosita Apodaca
*important... the dinner is at a restaurant (TBD) in Lafayette or Walnut Creek (near Orinda) — NOT at the high school
*important... dinner is likely 7pm on May 28, 2026
